title: "Assignment 8: Spatial Autocorrelation and Interpolation"
---

Exploring and exploiting spatial autocorrelation in our data is an important tool for interpolating missing values in geographic data. It's also an important diagnostic to check before additional statistical analyses. You'll get to try some of that out here. We'll the cost of natural disasters dataset fromm 1999-2020 (described in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01955-0) and available at `/assignment07/ics209-plus-wf_incidents_1999to2020.csv` folder and focusing on the data describing the structures lost to natural disaster (`STR_DESTROYED_TOTAL`). [For this assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/wlCo9WNT), we'll use this data to:

* Plot the Ripley's K envelope for a point dataset
* Use nearest-neighbors as a means of estimating Moran's I
* Generate several spatial field interpolations
* Krige data based on spatial patterns and semivariance

## Instructions

1. After you've joined the assignment repository, you should have this file (named Readme.md) inside of a R project named assignment-8-xx where xx is your github username (or initials).

2. Once you've verified that you've correctly cloned the assignment repository, create a new Quarto document. Name this file assignment-8-xxx.qmd and give it a title (like M Williamson Assignment 8). Make sure that you select the html output option (Quarto can do a lot of cool things, but the html format is the least-likely to cause you additional headaches). We'll be using Quarto throughout the course so it's worth checking out the other tutorials in the getting started section.

3. Copy the questions below into your document and change the color of their text.

4. Save the changes and make your first commit!

5. Answer the questions making sure save and commit at least 3 more times (having 4 commits is part of the assignment).

6. Render the document to html (you should now have at least 3 files in the repository: Readme.md, assignment-8-xx.qmd, and assignment-8-xx.html). Commit these changes and push them to the repository on GitHub. You should see the files there when you go to github.com.
