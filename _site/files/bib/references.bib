abstract = {A large number of methods for the analysis of point pattern data have been developed in a wide range of scientific fields. First-order statistics describe large-scale variation in the intensity of points in a study region, whereas second-order characteristics are summary statistics of all point-to-point distances in a mapped area and offer the potential for detecting both different types and scales of patterns. Second-order analysis based on Ripley's K-function is increasingly used in ecology to characterize spatial patterns and to develop hypothesis on underlying processes; however, the full range of available methods has seldomly been applied by ecologists. The aim of this paper is to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in second-order analysis to help in the choice of appropriate methods and to point to practical difficulties and pitfalls. We review (1) methods for analytical and numerical implementation of two complementary second-order statistics, Ripley's K and the O-ring statistic, (2) methods for edge correction, (3) methods to account for first-order effects (i.e. heterogeneity) of univariate patterns, and (4) a variety of useful standard and non-standard null models for univariate and bivariate patterns. For illustrative purpose, we analyze examples that deal with non-homogeneous univariate point patterns. We demonstrate that large-scale heterogeneity of a point-pattern biases Ripley's K-function at smaller scales. This bias is difficult to detect without explicitly testing for homogeneity, but we show that it can be removed when applying methods that account for first-order effects. We synthesize our review in a number of step-by-step recommendations that guide the reader through the selection of appropriate methods and we provide a software program that implements most of the methods reviewed and developed here.},

@article{Stoltzfus2011,
  title = "Logistic regression: a brief primer",
  author = "Stoltzfus, Jill C",
  abstract = "Regression techniques are versatile in their application to
              medical research because they can measure associations, predict
              outcomes, and control for confounding variable effects. As one
              such technique, logistic regression is an efficient and powerful
              way to analyze the effect of a group of independent variables on
              a binary outcome by quantifying each independent variable's
              unique contribution. Using components of linear regression
              reflected in the logit scale, logistic regression iteratively
              identifies the strongest linear combination of variables with the
              greatest probability of detecting the observed outcome. Important
              considerations when conducting logistic regression include
              selecting independent variables, ensuring that relevant
              assumptions are met, and choosing an appropriate model building
              strategy. For independent variable selection, one should be
              guided by such factors as accepted theory, previous empirical
              investigations, clinical considerations, and univariate
              statistical analyses, with acknowledgement of potential
              confounding variables that should be accounted for. Basic
              assumptions that must be met for logistic regression include
              independence of errors, linearity in the logit for continuous
              variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of strongly
              influential outliers. Additionally, there should be an adequate
              number of events per independent variable to avoid an overfit
              model, with commonly recommended minimum ``rules of thumb''
              ranging from 10 to 20 events per covariate. Regarding model
              building strategies, the three general types are direct/standard,
              sequential/hierarchical, and stepwise/statistical, with each
              having a different emphasis and purpose. Before reaching
              definitive conclusions from the results of any of these methods,
              one should formally quantify the model's internal validity (i.e.,
              replicability within the same data set) and external validity
              (i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample). The resulting
              logistic regression model's overall fit to the sample data is
              assessed using various goodness-of-fit measures, with better fit
              characterized by a smaller difference between observed and
              model-predicted values. Use of diagnostic statistics is also
              recommended to further assess the adequacy of the model. Finally,
              results for independent variables are typically reported as odds
              ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).",

              supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still
              scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that
              successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the
              grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and
              learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs
              are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from
              biological invasions, identification of critical habitats,
              reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we
              propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of

              transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate
              SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers
              need to better understand the decision process, and decision
              makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual
              use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be
              facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of
              'translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage
              species distribution modellers to get involved in real
              decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical
              input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory

               how interactions between data type and the sampling process

               data is frequently perceived to be a useful technique. Models
               that predict the presence or absence of a species are normally
               judged by the number of prediction errors. These may be of two
               types: false positives and false negatives. Many of the

abstract = {Classification procedures are some of the most widely used statistical methods in ecology. Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.},

abstract = {Abstract Selecting among competing statistical models is a core challenge in science. However, the many possible approaches and techniques for model selection, and the conflicting recommendations for their use, can be confusing. We contend that much confusion surrounding statistical model selection results from failing to first clearly specify the purpose of the analysis. We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.},

abstract = {Biodiversity assessments use a variety of data and models. We propose best-practice standards for studies in these assessments. Demand for models in biodiversity assessments is rising, but which models are adequate for the task? We propose a set of best-practice standards and detailed guidelines enabling scoring of studies based on species distribution models for use in biodiversity assessments. We reviewed and scored 400 modeling studies over the past 20 years using the proposed standards and guidelines. We detected low model adequacy overall, but with a marked tendency of improvement over time in model building and, to a lesser degree, in biological data and model evaluation. We argue that implementation of agreed-upon standards for models in biodiversity assessments would promote transparency and repeatability, eventually leading to higher quality of the models and the inferences used in assessments. We encourage broad community participation toward the expansion and ongoing development of the proposed standards and guidelines.}}
