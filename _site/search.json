Your analysis should incorporate at least 5 datasets. The ultimate compostion of your database is up to you, but I’d like you to include 1 tabular dataset, 1 vector dataset, and 1 raster dataset. You should choose the other 2 (or more) to give you practice with the data types that are most relevant to your objectives and/or research.\nAnalyses. You’ve learned several classes of analyses (e.g., overlays, point-pattern, multivariate regression, and statistical learning). Apply at least one (preferably the one most tied to your own objectives and research) of these analyses to address your question. In the course of doing so, you’ll need to justify your choice, assess whether your data meets appropriate assumptions, and evaluate the implications of key assumptions you make. For example, if you’re conducting an overlay analysis, how does your choice of threshold affect the ultimate result? If you’ve fit a statistical model based on summary statistics (e.g, mean, median), how well does the model fit? How does the model change if you use different slices of the data?\nVisualizations. You should produce a minimum of 3 visualizations to accompany your analysis. One of these should be a publication quality location map. The others are up to you, but should a) help you tell the story of your analysis and b) help you meet your objectives for the course and your own research. These can be additional maps of results, figures that summarize your data or results in non-spatial ways, or interactive graphics that allow you to explore parts of your analysis.\nReporting You can generate a ‘manuscript’ style document (using Quarto) or a flexdashboard (using Quarto and shiny) as the final product. Your report should include:\n\nA brief (1-2 paragraphs) description of your question and why you’re interested in it.\nA Methods section with subsections describing the data sources, any processing steps you took and why, and your process for the analysis. Show your code and provide annotation to describe what you are attempting do with the various steps.\nA Results section that includes tabular results as well as any relevant visualizations that describe your data and analysis.\nA Discussion of your results that puts your results in the context of your question, considers alternative analysis strategies and why they may or may not be better than the approach you chose, describes additional data that might be important for your question, and considers the role of extent and resolution in your analysis."

Each assignment integrates concepts from multiple class sessions in an effort to cement new concepts and make sure you don’t forget things you learned earlier in the semester. As such, they involve multiple sections and may take some time. Each week I’ll announce which sections of the homework are most applicable so that you know about where you should be in terms of completing it. The idea is to have you work a bit on the homework throughout each unit. This is to reduce the likelihood that you’ll spend 10 hours on it the day before it’s due and also to encourage you to get in the habit of using git to keep track of your progress.\nI’ll be grading these according to: * Please Resubmit: This indicates that either your code does not run as written (i.e., your Rmarkdown document will not compile on my computer), you did not use Git as instructed, and/or that your responses to the questions I posed indicate that you do not quite understand the material as well as I would like. You’ll need to schedule an appointment to talk with me and we’ll work out what you need to do to get credit for the assignment. Although there isn’t a hard deadline for this resubmission, the assignments build on each other so it’s in your best interest to complete the resubmission before the next assignment. Failure to resubmit will result in no credit for the assignment.\n\nResubmit If You Like: This indicates that all of the code works as written and that you used Git, but that you may have missed some important concepts. Your are welcome to resubmit the assignment and address my comments to help polish the final product, but it is not required for you to get credit for the assignment.\nGood To Go: All of your code works, you completed the necessary Git steps, and all of the pieces are there and polished. I may have some minor comments, but I don’t need you to address them for this assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLate Work: There is no such thing as ‘late work’ with these assignments. Life happens, sometimes things take longer to finish than you expect. If you turn it in, I’ll give you feedback. That said, the assignments build on each other so it’s probably best to avoid falling too far behind."

    "text": "RStudio on your computer\nRStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\n\nInstall R\nFirst you need to install R itself (the engine).\n\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now, the current version is 4.2.1) and download it.\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nIf you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nThe tidyverse consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nYou can install packages manually in RStudio, but this can be a bit fragile, especially for some of the spatial packages. Instead of using the RStudio GUI we’ll just install thins at the prompt. To install the tidyverse pacakge (and all of its associated dependencies) run the following: install.packages(\"tidyverse\")."

This e-mail is sent every Monday and is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r scatterplot”, but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats scatterplot”). Also, since most of your R work in this class will deal with ggplot2, it’s often easier to just search for that instead of the letter “r” (e.g. “ggplot scatterplot”).\nThese resources are also really really helpful:\n\n\n\nAn Introduction to R: The definitive introductory text by Venables, Smith, and the R Core Team.\nSwirl: A set of free, self-contained tutorials that run from within your RStudio terminal.\nR for Data Science: A free online book for learning the basics of R and the tidyverse.\nR and RStudio cheat sheets: A large collection of simple cheat sheets for RStudio, ggplot2, and other R-related things.\nStat 545: Dr. Jenny Bryan at RStudio has an entire introductory course in R, visualization, and data analysis online.\nSTA 112FS: Data Science: Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel at the University of Edinburgh / Duke University has an entire introductory course in R, visualization, and data science online.\nCSE 631: Principles & Practice of Data Visualization: Yet another introductory course for R and ggplot2 by Dr. Alison Presmanes Hill at RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nsf cheatsheet: An at-a-glance description of the various sf verbs and their application.\nGeocomputation with R: Online version of the textbook by Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow.\n[Robert’s Page]"

My goal is to foster an environment where we are all learning from each other and sharing the tips and tricks that help us along the way. Learning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. I find it helpful to remember the following:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.\n\n— Hadley Wickham\n\n\nIf you want to start learning a few of the basics, the Resources tab has some background information to get you started. Note that this is not an exhaustive list - the number of new R tutorials available on the internet seems to be growing exponentially.\n\nGetting Help With R problems\nI am happy to help you work through your R coding challenges, but there are a lot of you and only one of me. Moreover, I may not always know exactly how to fix your problem any better than you do. In order to make sure that I am not the primary obstacle to your ability to complete the class assignments, I’m asking that you use the following steps prior to emailing/Slacking me with your coding questions. When you send me a question, please let me know what you searched, why the solutions you found don’t work for you, and what output you are expecting We’ll spend a bit of time on asking better questions and getting better answers so don’t worry if you aren’t quite sure how this all works.\n\nGoogle it! Searching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r reproject polygons”, but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats reproject polygons”). Also, since most of your R work will deal with the RSpatial packages, it’s often easier to just search for the package name and operation rather than the letter “r” (e.g. “sf reproject polygons”). I often paste the specific error message I get along with the spatial package I’m using to try and help Google find my solutions.\nAsk your colleagues We have an r_spatial chatroom at Slack where anyone in this class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about code or class materials. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too. As a bonus, Slack allows you to format code to make it easy for all of us to copy and paste your code and distinguish it from the rest of your question.\nUse the forums Two of the most important sources for help with R-coding are StackOverflow (a Q&A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). If you aren’t able to find an answer to your question from the thousands of existing questions, you can post your own. You’ll need to create a reproducible example so others can figure out what you’re trying to do and what error you’re receiving, but you’d be amazed how helpful the community can be.\nAsk me! Sign up for a time to meet with me during student hours at https://calendly.com/mattwilliamson/. I’ll want to know what searches you’ve tried (so I don’t chase down answers that you’ve already seen) and what approaches you’ve tried and why they haven’t worked. Remember, I’m here to help (but not write your code for you)."

To make life easier, I have set up an online RStudio server service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer and we should be able to avoid a number of the machine-specific issues that pop-up when 20 students have 20 different computers, operating systems (OS), etc. If you haven’t installed R on your local machine and would like some help getting that set up, there’ a useful set of instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n\n\nGit and Github Classroom\nAll assignments will be managed using Github classroom. This will allow each you to have your own repositories for each assignment and make it easier for me to comment on and help with your code. To use this, you should sign up for the GitHub Student Developers Pack as soon as possible and send me your github username. Once I have that, I can add you to the course and make sure that you have access to all of the necessary data and example code.\n\n\nReadings\nThe goal of this course is primarily to get you started with spatial workflows in R. That said, maps (and the spatial data that produce them) are extremely powerful. Although most of this course will focus on getting the code right, I’ll mix in a few readings each week to help tie the technical details of our code back to the broader contexts of spatial analysis."

    "text": "Assignments and Grades\nI teach this course because I believe that a) we can learn a lot about social and ecological processes by studying where they happen, b) integrating spatial analysis directly into statistical workflows makes those analyses more robust and reproducible, and c) overcoming coding challenges can provide a profound sense of accomplishment. That said, I recognize that there are many reasons that you are taking this course and that my objectives may differ from yours. In order to make sure that you get what you need out of this class, we’ll be using a mix of approaches for determining your grade in this course.\nSelf-assessment: During the first week of the course, I’m going to ask you to reflect on what you want out of this course (concepts, skills, practice, etc.). This assessment will help me do a better job of aligning the content of the course to your specific needs. We’ll check in on this mid-semester to make sure things are on track and again at the end of the semester to give you a chance to evaluate how well you did in the course. Grading for the self-assessment is described on the assignments page.\nExercises: There are four homework assignments, one for each ‘unit’ of the course. These exercises are designed to reinforce the material we cover in lecture, give you practice designing and implementing your own workflows, and build habits that promote reproducibility in science. Rather than assign arbitrary points to each assignment, I’m going to grade your assignments using the following ‘levels’ (inspired by Sarah K. Johnson’s description of her graduate data analysis course at Tufts):\n\nPlease Resubmit: This indicates that either your code does not run as written (i.e., your Rmarkdown document will not compile on my computer), you did not use Git as instructed, and/or that your responses to the questions I posed indicate that you do not quite understand the material as well as I would like. You’ll need to schedule an appointment to talk with me and we’ll work out what you need to do to get credit for the assignment. Although there isn’t a hard deadline for this resubmission, the assignments build on each other so it’s in your best interest to complete the resubmission before the next assignment. Failure to resubmit will result in no credit for the assignment.\nResubmit If You Like: This indicates that all of the code works as written and that you used Git, but that you may have missed some important concepts. Your are welcome to resubmit the assignment and address my comments to help polish the final product, but it is not required for you to get credit for the assignment.\nGood To Go: All of your code works, you completed the necessary Git steps, and all of the pieces are there and polished. I may have some minor comments, but I don’t need you to address them for this assignment.\n\nFinal Project: The final project asks you to conduct an entire spatial analysis from layout to results. Grades on the final project are based on your objectives and your self-assessment of whether or not you achieved those objectives. Your first draft of the final project will be due December 2. I’ll make comments based on the same categories for the assignments and you’ll have time to revise your submission prior to the final deadline of December 16.\nYou can find descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n\nGrades\nWe’ll use a form of contract grading to determine your grades in the course. Contract grading allows us to have a conversation about what you want out of the course, what you expect to put into it, and what I think you need to be successful in deploying the skills we learn here. Based on your goals for course, we’ll sign a contract that instantiates your objectives into the grade you’ll recieve for the course. Complete the assignments and meet your objectives and you’ll get the grade you chose.\nThe expectations for the grades are:\n\nA You complete all of the self-assessments and 4 of the assignments (including the final project) to the “Good to Go” level and 1 to the “Resubmit If You Like” level. In addition, you meet or exceed 90% of your objectives for the course and the final project.\nB You complete all of the self-assessments and 3 of the assignments (including the final project) to the “Good to Go” level and 2 to the “Resubmit If You Like” level. In addition, you meet or exceed 80% of your objectives for the course and the final project.\nC You complete all of the self-assessments and 2 of the assignments (including the final project) to the “Good to Go” level and 3 to the “Resubmit If You Like” level.

In addition, you meet or exceed 60% of your objectives for the course and the final project.\n\n\n\nAttendance and incomplete assignments\nAttendance is an important part of this course. You are allowed to miss 2 classes without providing any justification (stuff happens). Beyond that, each additional absence will result in a 0.5 grading reduction (i.e., an A becomes and A-). Similarly, completing the assignments to a satisfactory level is vital to ensure you have a firm grip on the code and concepts. Hence, each assignment that fails to achieve a “Resubmit If You Like” will result in 0.5 grading reduction.\n\n\nLate work\nWith the exception of the self-assessments and the final project, there’s no such thing as late work. I would highly recommend staying caught up as much as possible, but if you need to turn something in late, that’s fine—there’s no penalty."

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nAcademic integrity is the principle that asks students to engage with their academic work to the fullest and to behave honestly, transparently, and ethically in every assignment and every interaction with a peer, professor, or research participant. When a strong culture of academic integrity is fostered by students and faculty in an academic program, students learn more, build positive relationships and collaborations, and can feel more confident in the value of their degrees.\nIn order to cultivate fairness and credibility, everyone must participate in upholding academic integrity. Students in this class are responsible for asking for help or clarification when it’s needed, speaking up when they see unethical behavior taking place, and understanding and adhering to the Student Code of Conduct, including the section on academic misconduct. Boise State and I take academic misconduct very seriously. It’s important to know that when a student engages in academic misconduct, I will report the incident to the Office of the Dean of Students. I also have the right to assign sanctions, which could include requirements to revise or redo work, complete educational assignments to learn about academic integrity, and grade penalties ranging from lower credit on an assignment to failing this class1. Students should learn more by reviewing the Student Code of Conduct."
