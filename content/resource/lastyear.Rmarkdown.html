<p>Although this year’s course has been reoriented quite a bit, last year’s website has a lot of worked code examples that might help you.</p>
<div id="relevant-tabs" class="section level2">
<h2>Relevant Tabs</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/example/"><strong>Examples</strong></a>: The examples tab for last year’s webpage has several long-form descriptions of workflows for conducting different spatial analyses.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/content/"><strong>Content</strong></a>: The content tab has access to past lectures and old readings. Probably the most useful pieces are the code chunks in the slides.</p></li>
</ul>
