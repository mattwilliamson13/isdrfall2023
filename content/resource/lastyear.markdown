Although this year's course has been reoriented quite a bit, last year's website has a lot of worked code examples that might help you.

## Relevant Tabs
- [**Examples**](https://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/example/): The examples tab for last year's webpage has several long-form descriptions of workflows for conducting different spatial analyses.

- [**Content**](https://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/content/): The content tab has access to past lectures and old readings. Probably the most useful pieces are the code chunks in the slides.
