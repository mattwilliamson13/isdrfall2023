## Learning R

I highly recommend subscribing to the [R Weekly newsletter](https://rweekly.org/). This e-mail is sent every Monday and is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.

Searching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for "r scatterplot", but if it does struggle, try searching for "rstats" instead (e.g. "rstats scatterplot"). Also, since most of your R work in this class will deal with **ggplot2**, it's often easier to just search for that instead of the letter "r" (e.g. "ggplot scatterplot"). 

These resources are also really really helpful:
