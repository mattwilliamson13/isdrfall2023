# Outline for today {background="#0033A0"}

- Update on assignments

- Refresher: Building a spatial analysis workflow

- Building a database for an analysis (part 2) based on location


## Update on assignments

- Assignment 2 due by 14 Oct

- Self-assessment due 18 Oct

- Resubmits

- Final Project


## Objectives

By the end of today you should be able to:

- Create new features based on topological relationships

- Use topological subsetting to reduce features

- Use spatial joins to add attributes based on location

# Revisiting Spatial Analysis {background="#0033A0"}

## What is spatial analysis?

> "The process of examining the locations, attributes, and relationships of features in spatial data through overlay and other analytical techniques in order to address a question or gain useful knowledge. Spatial analysis extracts or creates new information from spatial data".

- Align processing with objectives

- Imagining the visualizations and analysis clarifies file formats and variables

- Helps build reproducibility

- Attributes: Information that further describes a spatial feature

- Attributes &rightarrow; predictors for analysis 

- Last week focus on thematic relations between datasets
  - Shared 'keys' help define linkages between objects

- Sometimes we are interested in attributes that describe location (overlaps, contains, distance)

- Sometimes we want to join based on location rather than thematic connections
  - __Must have the same CRS__
