## Common measures

* Graph-level: density, diameter, distance

* Component-level: density, distribution

* Node-level: centrality, degree-distribution

## Common questions

* What are the shortest paths across the network?

* Where are the most important locations for maintaining the network?

* How does the loss of a node alter the subsequent configuration of the network?

* How do we translate typical movement paths into network structures?
