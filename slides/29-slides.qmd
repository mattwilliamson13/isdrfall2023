# Objectives {background="#9F281A"}

By the end of today you should be able to:

* Describe some basic principles of data visualization

* Extend principles of data visualization to the development of maps

* Distinguish between several common types of spatial data visualization


# Introduction to Data Visualization {background="#9F281A"}

## Principles vs. Rules
::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
  - Lots of examples of _good_ and _bad_ data visualization
  
  - What makes a graphic good (or bad)?
  
  - Who decides?
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  - __Rule:__ externally compels you, through force, threat or punishment, to do the things someone else has deemed good or right.
  
  - __Principle:__ internally motivating because it is a _good practice_; a general statement describing a philosophy that good rules should satisfy
  
  - Rules contribute to the design process, but do not guarantee a satisfactory outcome

> "Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data—a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design … [It] consists of complex ideas  communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. … [It] is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space … [It] is nearly always multivariate … And graphical excellence requires telling the truth about the data." 
`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Edward Tufte')`


## Ugly, Wrong, and Bad

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- _Ugly_: graphic is clear and informative, but has aesthetic issues
  
- _Bad_: graphic is unclear, confusing, or decieving
  
- _Wrong_: the figure is objectively incorrect

## Bad and Wrong

- Presentation of the data is (intentionally?) decieving

- Presentation is just incorrect

## Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2005)

- _Grammar_: A set of structural rules that help establish the components of a language

- System and structure of language consist of _syntax_ and _semantics_

- _Grammar of Graphics_: a framework that allows us to concisely describe the components of any graphic

- Follows a layered approach by using defined components to build a visualization

- `ggplot2` is a formal implementation in `R`

## Aesthetics: Mapping Data to Visual Elements

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
- Define the systematic conversion of data into elements of the visualization

- Are either categorical or continuous (exclusively)

- Examples include `x`, `y`, `fill`, `color`, and `alpha`

## Scales

- Scales map data values to their aesthetics

- Must be a one-to-one relationship; each specific data value should map to only one aesthetic


## Principles of Data Visualization

- Be Honest

- Principle of proportional ink

- Avoid unnecessary 'chart junk'

- Use color judiciously

- Balance data and context

## Telling stories with maps

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](img/slide_29/caworldview.png)
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Maps organize a lot of information in a coherent way

- They invite critique and inspection

- They are also aesthetic objects that can engage broader audiences
:::
:::

## Key Issues

- Thinking about projections

- Scale of the map

- Errors of Omission

## Cartographic Principles

1. Concept before compilation

2. Hierarchy with harmony (Important things should look important)

3. Simplicity from sacrifice

4. Maximum information at minimum cost

5. Engage emotion to enhance understanding

## Scale

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
* Relates map distance to distance on the ground

* Ratio scales (1:24,000 or 1/24,000)

* Graphic scales

* Large vs. small-scale?

## Projection

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![Developable Surfaces](img/slide_29/projections.png)
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

* Distortion makes scale invalid across large areas

* Distortion increases with distance from standard line

* Five distortions: areas, angles, shapes, distances, and direction
:::
:::

## Map Symbols

::: columns
:::{.column width="60%"}
![](img/slide_29/visvariables.png)
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
* Graphic code for retrieving information

* (De-)emphasize (un)important information

* Contrast and the role of colors

> A good map tells a multitude of little white lies: it supresses truth to help the user see what needs to be seen...

## Geometry

![Zhilin et al. 2008](img/slide_29/generalization.png)

## Context

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
* Filter out irrelevant details

* Two elements: selection and classification

* Reflect interpretations of the relative importance of different features
