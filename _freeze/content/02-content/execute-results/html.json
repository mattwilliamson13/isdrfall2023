We'll spend some time on the various conceptualizations of place and space, how those things show up in geographic data, and their implications for the kinds of science we can do when we're using geographic data. This session is meant to provide a bit of philosophical foundation for you to keep in mind as you work through various parts of the analytic pipeline.\n\n## Readings\n\n\n\n## Objectives\nBy the end of today you should be able to:\n\n* **Identify** major applications of geographical analysis\n\n* **Describe** critiques and limitations of quantitative geographical analysis \n\n* **Define** 'scale' and its implications for geographic analysis\n\n* **Place** your research in the broader context of geographic analysis\n\n## Slides\n\nThe slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file.
